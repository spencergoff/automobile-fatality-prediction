# automobile-fatality-prediction
Attempts to accurately predict the number of fatalities caused by automobile-related incidents given the hour, day of the week, and the current weather conditions. 

The file crashes_hour_day_weather.csv was organized by me using data from https://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/QueryTool/querysection/selectyear.aspx

I documented the steps I took to query this data in automobile-fatalities-query-steps.pdf.
