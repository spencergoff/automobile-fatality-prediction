This project had two major goals. The first of these goals was to uncover the factors that contribute most to automobile-related fatalities, analyzing patterns in this number that occurred nationwide in 2016 under given sets of conditions involving weather, time, and day of the week. Using the Pearson Coefficient, it was determined that the weather has the most significant impact on the number of automobile-related fatalities. The second of the projectâ€™s goals was to optimize the parameters of a densely-connected neural network regressor to obtain the most accurate results. Bearing in mind that the data used contained 1680 data points with 3 features each, the optimal parameters were found to be six layers with three neurons each.  The steps taken in this project and the results and analysis can be found below. The data and code for this project can be found on Github under the title automobile-fatality-prediction. 

A densely-connected neural network was utilized, along with Tensorflow's DNNRegressor.
